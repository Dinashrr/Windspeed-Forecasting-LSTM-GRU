# Windspeed-Forecasting-LSTM-GRU
## Time Series Forecasting of windspeed with LSTM and GRU RNNs
  Deep Learning methods performs well on large amount of dataset. 
  In this repository an implementation of different Recurrent Neural Network types such as LSTM and GRU is shown for time series forecasting and prediction.
